# Ground-Truth-Generation
An Image Processing Tool to Generate Ground Truth Data from Satellite Images using DeepÂ Learning

Download complete folder and install all packages from requirements.txt, However, all libraries listed in requirements.txt is not required. If you have memory issue with your system then install manually, else install all using 
pip install -r requirements.txt

To train model from scratch run 'trainModel.py'.

To test trained model run 'testDBimage.py', This will select test images from database and generate result.

To test with random satellite image run 'test_random_image.py'.
